# Decisions and Loops
## Evaluating condition 
### You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what ypu expect it might be. The resuklt will be a Boolean: true or false.
## Examples
# == (Is Equal to)
# != (Is not Equal to)
# === (Strict Equal to)
# !== (Strict not Equal to)
# > (Greater than)
# < (Less than)
# >-= (Greater than or Equal to)
# <= (Less than or Equal to) 
## Logical operators 
### Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
## Examples:
# && (Logical and): This operator tests more than one condition.
# II ( logical or): This operator tests at least one condition.
# ! (Logical not): this operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.
## If statements
### The *if* statement evaluates (or checks) a condation. If the condation evaluates to true, any statement in the subsequent code block are executed.
